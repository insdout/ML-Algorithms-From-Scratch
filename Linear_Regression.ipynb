    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a foundational technique in statistics and machine learning that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables. In this chapter, we will delve into the concepts of linear regression, its assumptions, mathematical representation, and different solution methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying linear regression, it's important to consider its underlying assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality**: The residuals follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the following terms for the mathematical formulation of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X**: The matrix of independent variables (features), with an added column of ones for the intercept term.\n",
    "- **y**: The vector of target values.\n",
    "- **θ**: The vector of coefficients (weights) that we want to optimize.\n",
    "- **n**: The number of data points.\n",
    "- **m**: The number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended linear regression equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = Xθ + ε\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where ε represents the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direct Solution: Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find the optimal coefficients θ directly is by using the normal equation. The normal equation provides an analytical solution to the least squares problem, minimizing the sum of squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "θ = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X^T}$: The transpose of the feature matrix X.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{y}$: The vector of target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal equation directly calculates the optimal values of θ that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to find the coefficients θ that minimize the difference between the predicted values (Xθ) and the actual target values (y). The most common loss function used is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(θ) = \\frac{1}{2n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i -  \\sum_{j=1}^{k}X_{i,j}θ_j)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of data points, and $X_i$ represents the i-th row of the feature matrix X.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent for Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. The gradient of the loss function with respect to the coefficients θ is computed, and θ is updated in the opposite direction of the gradient. The update rule is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "θ := θ - α \\nabla J(θ)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where α is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient of the loss function can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla J(θ) =  X^T(Xθ - y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression serves as a powerful tool for modeling relationships between variables. By considering its assumptions and understanding various solution methods, such as gradient descent and the normal equation, we can apply linear regression effectively to various prediction tasks. Its simplicity, interpretability, and versatility make linear regression a cornerstone of both statistical analysis and machine learning.\n"
